## 1. Introduction

This project proposes the development of a Solar MPPT Controller Calculator that determines the correct MPPT solar charge controller based on user-provided solar panel specifications, environmental conditions, and battery bank voltage. The system ensures compliance with NEC standards and manufacturer safety requirements.

## 2. Project Objectives

- Accurately calculate solar array electrical parameters.
- Apply National Electrical Code (NEC) Table 690.7(A) temperature correction factors to open circuit voltage.
- Filter MPPT controllers based on battery bank voltage compatibility.
- Select a controller rated appropriately for voltage and current requirements.
- Ensure short circuit current safety validation based on manufacturer datasheets (Victron's Datasheets).

## 3. Solar Array Calculations

### 3.1 Total Power

**Formula:** `Total Power = PMAX × Number of Panels`

### 3.2 Open Circuit Voltage (Corrected)

**Formula:** `Open Circuit Voltage = VOC × Panels in Series × Temperature Factor`

- Temperature Factor is based on NEC Table 690.7(A) for -13°F (-25°C).

### 3.3 Maximum Charge Current

**Formula:** `Max Charge Current = Total Power ÷ Battery Charge Voltage`

**Battery Charge Voltage:**

- 14.7V for 12V battery bank
- 29.4V for 24V battery bank

### 3.4 Short Circuit Current

**Formula:** `Short Circuit Current = ISC(victron datasheet) × Panels in Parallel`

## 4. Writeup Overview

### 4.1 Project Abstract

Our group proposes the development of a browser-based application called the Solar Charge Controller Calculator, built in partnership with Xantrex. The application aims to help end customers determine the correct MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) solar charge controller for their solar panel installation. Users would input their solar panel specifications—such as maximum power (PMAX), open circuit voltage (VOC), short circuit current (ISC), and panel configuration in series and parallel—along with their battery bank voltage and geographic location. The system would then perform NEC-compliant electrical calculations, apply location-based temperature correction factors retrieved via the OpenWeatherMap REST API, and recommend the most appropriately sized Xantrex MPPT controller that satisfies all voltage, current, and short circuit safety requirements. The proposed application also includes a secure administrative backend with login authentication, allowing authorized Xantrex personnel to manage the controller database through full CRUD operations, ensuring the calculator always reflects the current product lineup. This project fulfills the course requirements by incorporating a login system and integrating at least one web REST API for real-time weather data retrieval.

### 4.2 Overview of Existing Systems

Currently, selecting the correct MPPT charge controller is a manual and error-prone process. Customers are expected to read and interpret solar panel datasheets on their own, manually look up NEC Table 690.7(A) temperature correction factors, perform voltage and current calculations by hand or with generic spreadsheets, and then cross-reference their results against individual controller specification sheets to find a compatible unit. This workflow demands a level of electrical engineering knowledge that most end customers simply do not have.

### 4.3 How This Project Improves on Existing Solutions

This project proposes to consolidate the entire selection workflow into one web application where the user simply enters their panel specs and location, and the system handles the rest. It would automate NEC temperature correction using real weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, perform manufacturer-specific short circuit current validation, and intelligently select the smallest compatible controller to optimize cost.

### 4.4 Target Audience

Xantrex end customers home-owners

### 4.5 Scope of the Project

The project covers a full-stack web application: a public calculator interface, backend NEC-standard computation logic, OpenWeatherMap API integration for temperature correction, a Xantrex controller database, and a secure admin CRUD interface with login authentication. Wiring diagram generation, e-commerce integration, and battery banks beyond 12V/24V are outside the current scope and may be addressed in future iterations.

    - **Delete:** Remove discontinued or obsolete controllers from the database.
- **Value:** Allows authorized personnel to maintain an accurate and up-to-date controller catalog without requiring code changes, ensuring the calculator always recommends current Xantrex products.
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Admin must log in with valid credentials to access the dashboard.
  - Unauthorized users cannot access the management interface.
  - Admin can add, view, edit, and delete controller entries.
  - The public calculator uses the updated controller data in real time.
  - Input validation prevents incomplete or invalid controller entries.

### Epic 7: Weather API Integration and Automatic Temperature Correction

- **Goal:** Automatically retrieve location-based temperature data via a REST API to apply the correct voltage correction factor for the user's region.
- **Description:**
  - Allow the user to input their city or region.
  - Send a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the historical minimum temperature for that location.
  - Map the retrieved temperature to the appropriate voltage correction factor.
  - Automatically apply the correction factor to the Open Circuit Voltage calculation.
  - Display the retrieved temperature and applied correction factor to the user for transparency.
  - If the api fails, ask for the minimum and maximum temperature of the region manually.

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The user can input their city or region.
  - The system successfully calls the OpenWeatherMap API and retrieves temperature data.
  - The correct correction factor is selected based on the retrieved temperature.

## 8. Meeting Summary

### Meeting 1 - January 22, 2025 (In-Person)

Our first group meeting served as an introduction where all five members got to know each other. Each member shared their background in computer science, including previous coursework, programming languages they are comfortable with, and areas of strength. This helped the group understand what each person can contribute and laid the groundwork for assigning roles in future iterations.

### Meeting 2 - February 10, 2025 (In-Person)

The group met to review the project requirements outlined in the proposal assignment. We discussed the deliverables, marking criteria, and the expectations for each iteration. We also prepared a list of questions to bring to our first meeting with the client, covering topics such as user type, authentication needs, database requirements, API usage, integration with the existing Xantrex website, and desired features.

### Meeting 3 - February 11, 2025 (Client Meeting with Ling Weng and Angela Shi)

We met with our clients Ling Weng and Angela Shi from Xantrex. Key takeaways from the meeting included that the calculator is intended for end customers rather than internal staff, so no login is required from Xantrex's perspective. The core functionality involves the user inputting solar panel specifications and receiving a recommended Xantrex controller along with a generated wiring diagram. The client emphasized ease of use and consistency with the existing Xantrex website design. Location-based temperature data was discussed as an important factor for accurate calculations, with maximum temperature being the primary input and minimum temperature being optional but desirable. The client also mentioned the possibility of redirecting users to a purchase page after receiving their result. The group was tasked with researching the calculation standards and coming up with the logic independently.

### Meeting 4 - February 17, 2025 (Online)

The group met to divide the proposal workload among members. Roles were assigned as follows: Greg is handling the writeup overview, Erfan is responsible for group meeting summaries and mandatory requirements, Anton is managing deliverables, and Huda is writing the introduction and functional epics. We are planning to meet again on either February 24 or 26 after class to discuss roles and tasks for iteration 1.
